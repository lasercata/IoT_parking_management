        This project focuses on the design of an IoT-based smart parking system dedicated to people with disabilities. The objective is to ensure fair usage of reserved parking spaces, prevent fraud related to authorization cloning, and improve accessibility by providing real-time availability and booking capabilities.

        Each parking space is equipped with an IoT node capable of detecting vehicle presence and verifying the validity of a disabled parking authorization. The system continuously monitors parking activity and communicates with a centralized backend that manages authorizations, detects anomalies, and informs law enforcement when violations are detected.

        In addition, an interface allows authorized users to visualize nearby available parking spaces, reserve a spot up to one hour in advance, and receive feedback on their parking session.

                The objective of this functional requirement is to detect the presence of a vehicle occupying a disabled parking space. This functionality constitutes the foundation of the smart parking system, as it triggers all subsequent processes such as authorization verification, fraud detection, and violation reporting.
                
                Within the context of an IoT-based parking system dedicated to people with disabilities, occupancy detection must be reliable, accurate, and continuously operational in outdoor urban environments. Any detection failure would directly impact the system’s ability to ensure fair usage of reserved parking spaces and to prevent misuse or fraud.

            \begin{indt}{\subsubsection{Conclusion}} %{{{3
                The magnetic ground sensor is selected as the most appropriate solution for occupancy detection in this project. Its robustness against environmental conditions such as rain, lighting variations, and temperature changes makes it particularly well suited for outdoor deployment in urban parking spaces. In addition, magnetic sensing does not involve the collection of visual data, thereby avoiding privacy issues associated with camera-based approaches.

                Although installation requires embedding the sensor into the ground, this constraint is acceptable for a long-term infrastructure dedicated to disabled parking spaces. The high detection reliability, low false positive rate, and compatibility with low-power IoT nodes make magnetic ground sensors the best choice for fulfilling FR1.

                The purpose of this functional requirement is to verify the validity of a disabled parking authorization when a vehicle is detected occupying a reserved parking space. This step is essential to distinguish between legitimate users and unauthorized vehicles, ensuring that disabled parking spaces are used fairly and in accordance with regulations.

                Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)–based authorization verification is selected as the most suitable solution for this project. BLE enables automatic and contactless identification of authorized users through a secure identifier broadcast by a registered device, such as a smartphone or a dedicated BLE tag. This approach balances ease of use for people with disabilities and technical feasibility for an IoT-based infrastructure.

                Compared to RFID, BLE offers a longer communication range and greater flexibility, while avoiding the privacy and computational complexity associated with camera-based license plate recognition. Furthermore, BLE is natively supported by many low-power microcontrollers, facilitating seamless integration with the parking space IoT nodes. As a result, BLE-based verification best satisfies the requirements of reliability, scalability, and user accessibility for FR2.

                The objective of this functional requirement is to detect the simultaneous use of the same disabled parking authorization across geographically distinct parking spaces. Authorization cloning represents a significant form of fraud, where a single valid identifier is duplicated or shared in order to illegally occupy multiple reserved spaces at the same time.

                Within the proposed IoT-based smart parking system, this requirement is primarily addressed at the backend level. By correlating authorization identifiers with spatial and temporal data received from distributed parking nodes, the system can identify inconsistencies that are physically impossible under normal usage conditions. This functionality is essential to ensure fairness, preserve trust in the system, and support law enforcement by automatically flagging suspicious behaviour.

                The objective of this functional requirement is to provide users with a clear and real-time visualization of available disabled parking spaces within a selected geographical area. This functionality directly improves accessibility for people with disabilities by reducing the time and effort required to locate an appropriate parking space, especially in dense urban environments.

                Within the IoT-based smart parking system, parking availability visualization serves as the primary user-facing interface. It relies on continuously updated parking spot status data collected from distributed IoT nodes and processed by the centralized backend. Accurate and intuitive visualization is essential to ensure user trust and to enable informed decision-making, particularly when combined with reservation capabilities.
